# 🕉️ Varanasi Street Food Guide

A local guide application built for Week 5 of the AI for Bharat challenge. This app helps locals and tourists discover authentic Varanasi street food with cultural context, slang translation, and traffic-aware recommendations.

## 🎯 Features

- **Street Food Explorer**: Browse 6+ authentic Varanasi street foods with detailed information
- **Banarasi Slang Translator**: Understand local food terminology
- **Time-Based Recommendations**: Get suggestions based on current time and availability
- **Traffic-Aware Routing**: Know when to visit to avoid crowds
- **Cultural Context**: Learn proper eating customs and traditions

## 🚀 How Kiro Accelerated Development

This project leveraged Kiro with a custom `.kiro/product.md` context file to:

1. **Local Knowledge Integration**: Kiro understood Varanasi-specific slang, food items, and cultural nuances through the custom context
2. **Rapid Prototyping**: Generated React components with authentic local data
3. **Cultural Accuracy**: Ensured translations and descriptions matched real Banarasi usage
4. **Traffic Pattern Logic**: Implemented time-based filtering based on local traffic patterns

### Example Kiro Commands Used:
```bash
# With .kiro/product.md context, Kiro understood:
"Add a new seasonal food item following Varanasi patterns"
"Translate this Banarasi food slang term"
"Create time-based filtering for morning vs evening foods"
```

## 📦 Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/varanasi-food-guide.git
cd varanasi-food-guide
npm install
npm run dev
